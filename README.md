# Self-Paced Reading Experiment for E-Prime 3

The experiment consists of an introduction, participant information form, exercise, and main experiment sequence.

## Task description

A self-paced reading experiment template with a moving window paradigm. Participants view a fixation point in the middle of the screen. Then the sentence appears with the letters replaced by underscores. Participants press the space bar in order to reveal a sentence segment. After having pressed the space bar again, the segment disappears and the subsequent segment appears. This continues until the last segment in the sentence. Some sentences are followed by a comprehension question with two answer alternatives.
